# 🧮 8-bit Vedic Multiplier (Urdhva Tiryakbhyam)

This project demonstrates the design and simulation of an **8-bit Vedic Multiplier** based on the **Urdhva Tiryakbhyam** Vedic mathematics sutra. It is efficient in terms of **speed, area, and power**, making it a great choice for use in DSP and embedded systems.

## 📌 Features

- ✔️ High-speed multiplication using Vedic math  
- ✔️ Modular 4-bit block-based design  
- ✔️ RTL written in Verilog HDL  
- ✔️ Functional and timing simulation included  
- ✔️ Schematic, area, delay, power reports provided  

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Verilog HDL  
- Xilinx Vivado / ModelSim / Cadence Genus (as used)  
- GTKWave  
- Genus / Innovus (for power and area)

## 📊 Performance Summary

| Parameter         | Value              |
|------------------:|--------------------|
| Technology        | 45nm               |
| Area              | [6070.680] µm²     |
| Delay             | [2000] ns          |
| Power             | [4.03493e] µW      |

## ✅ How It Works

The Vedic multiplier uses the **Urdhva Tiryakbhyam Sutra**, which performs multiplication vertically and crosswise. The 8-bit multiplier is implemented using smaller **4-bit Vedic multipliers**, which are then combined.

## 📌 Future Enhancements

- Extend to 16-bit or 32-bit Vedic Multiplier  
- ASIC Physical Design (Layout)  
- Pipelined version for better throughput
